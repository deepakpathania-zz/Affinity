A paired organ donation compatibility matching platform

## Inspiration
I wanted to build something like about.me so that paired organ seekers could have a personalised page for the duo details which can be circulated easily and can be used to check compatibility of different pairs.

## What it does
It basically helps duos find a compatibility score with other duos in which a person is willing to donate to the other person but is unable to do so because of incompatibility issues. Thus a duo can share the details of both the members and it will help them find a compatibility score with other duos to make an informed decision. Once the most compatible duos are matched, a medical expert verifies that they can now see each others' details and can carry on with the procedure.  

## How I built it
I built the front end using Bootstrap and Vanilla javascript. The entire back end is in PHP and MySQL was used for  database.
